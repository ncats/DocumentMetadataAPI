# DocumentMetadataAPI

Simple API for retrieving document metadata by PMID, PMC id, and/or DOI.
The dev instance is hosted at https://3md2qwxrrk.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/

Meets the proposed specifications:
```
REQUEST SPECIFICATION: 
GET /publications?pubids=PMID:30690000,PMID:82374,PMID:28736,PMID:8000234&request_id=1df88223-c0f8-47f5-a1f3-661b944c7849
- Expect up to 100 pubids in request
- the value of request_id should be roundtripped back in the metadata section
- SLO for p90 should be 150ms for a good user experience
- Caching of results server-side is recommended to achieve this SLO
- Return 400 in case of request error; 500 in case of server error; 200 if success
- 'Content-Type: application/json' is expected as a header response; no other headers are mandated at this time

            "abstract": "Recently, stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 reversed the high MDA- and NO-tissue values to the healthy levels. Thereby, BPC 157 therapy cured rats with bile duct ligation (BDL) (sacrifice at 2, 4, 6, 8 week). BPC 157-medication (10 μg/kg, 10 ng/kg) was continuously in drinking water (0.16 μg/ml, 0.16 ng/ml, 12 ml/rat/day) since awakening from surgery, or since week 4. Intraperitoneal administration was first at 30 min post-ligation, last at 24 h before sacrifice. Local bath BPC 157 (10 µg/kg) with assessed immediate normalization of portal hypertension was given immediately after establishing portal hypertension values at 4, 6, 8 week. BPC 157 therapy markedly abated jaundice, snout, ears, paws, and yellow abdominal tegmentum in controls since 4th week, ascites, nodular, steatotic liver with large dilatation of main bile duct, increased liver and/or cyst weight, decreased body weight. BPC 157 counteracts the piecemeal necrosis, focal lytic necrosis, apoptosis and focal inflammation, disturbed cell proliferation (Ki-67-staining), cytoskeletal structure in the hepatic stellate cell (α-SMA staining), collagen presentation (Mallory staining). Likewise, counteraction includes increased AST, ALT, GGT, ALP, total bilirubin, direct and indirect and decreased albumin serum levels. As the end-result appear normalized MDA- and NO-tissue values, next to Western blot of NOS2 and NOS3 in the liver tissue, and decreased IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β levels in liver tissue. Finally, although portal hypertension is sustained in BDL-rats, with BPC 157 therapy, portal hypertension in BDL-rats is either not even developed or rapidly abated, depending on the given BPC 157's regimen. Thus, BPC 157 may counteract liver fibrosis and portal hypertension."

## Updating the database

The database is populated from tab-separated (TSV) files where each row is one publication. The columns must appear in this order (minimum 10):

```
document_id  pub_year  pub_month  pub_day  journal_name  journal_abbrev  volume  issue  article_title  abstract
```

- `document_id` should be prefixed (`PMID:30690000`). Use `-` for an absent `pub_day`.
- Each PMID record is automatically duplicated under its PMC and DOI synonyms (fetched from the NCBI ID converter API), so you only need to supply PMID-keyed rows.

### Loading locally

`data_loader.py` has no CLI entry point, so loading is done via a short Python script:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import data_loader

client = MongoClient("mongodb://...")   # or omit arg for localhost
db = client['test']
data_loader.collection = db['documentMetadata']
data_loader.reference  = db['documentIds']

data_loader.process_file('/path/to/data.tsv')
```

To delete records instead of upsert, pass a plain text file with one `document_id` per line and call `process_file('/path/to/deletes.txt', is_delete=True)`.

### Via AWS Lambda (`data_loader.lambda_handler`)

The Lambda variant downloads a gzipped TSV from a GCS bucket and then upserts (or, if "deleted" appears in the filename, deletes). It expects this event payload:

```json
{
  "source": {
    "bucket": "my-gcs-bucket",
    "filepath": "path/to/data.tsv.gz",
    "hmac_key_id": "...",
    "hmac_secret": "..."
  }
}
```

It connects to MongoDB via the `connection_string` environment variable (required).

> **Note:** There is a known bug in the current source — `lambda_handler` passes `source_info['bucket']` and `source_info['filepath']` to `process_file` instead of the local path returned by `get_file`. The Lambda may not be functional without fixing this first.

### Comparison

| | Local script | Lambda |
|---|---|---|
| Data source | Local TSV file | Gzipped TSV from GCS |
| MongoDB auth | Any connection string you supply | `connection_string` env var on the Lambda |
| Synonyms | Fetched from NCBI API | Fetched from NCBI API |
| Delete support | `is_delete=True` | Filename must contain `"deleted"` |
| Known issues | None | Bug passing wrong path to `process_file` |
